                        <p class="cs-text">
                            During my internship at SEA Group (SeaTalk), I joined a team managing a developer 
                            platform and SDK that served over 1,000 integration partners across Southeast Asia. 
                            On the surface, things looked fine—we had steady adoption and positive feedback from 
                            developers who successfully integrated.
                        </p>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            But when I dove into the onboarding data, I discovered a troubling pattern: 40% of 
                            developers who started the integration process never completed it. They'd download the 
                            SDK, attempt to integrate, and then... disappear.

                                <strong>The hidden cost:</strong> We were losing nearly half of potential integration 
                                partners before they could create value. Even more concerning, we had no systematic 
                                way of understanding why they were leaving.

                            I started by mapping the entire onboarding funnel:

                            <li>SDK download: 100% (baseline)</li>

                        <p class="cs-text">
                            The biggest drop-off was between the first API call and successful authentication. 
                            Something was going wrong in those early steps.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="cs-subheading">2. Talking to Developers</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Data told me WHERE the problem was, but not WHY. I conducted 15 interviews with developers 
                            at different stages:

                            <li><strong>Those who abandoned:</strong> Why did they give up? (hardest to reach, but

                            Three clear patterns emerged:

                                <strong>Problem #1: Documentation gaps.</strong> Our docs assumed developers knew 
                                our authentication flow, but most were unfamiliar with it. Critical setup steps 
                                were buried in separate pages with no clear sequence.

                                messages were technical ("Auth token invalid") without explaining what to do about it.
                            </p>

                                developers wanted complete, copy-pasteable examples they could build from.

                    <div class="cs-content">
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            I wrote a comprehensive PRD (in both English and Chinese) proposing three key improvements:
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="cs-subheading">1. Restructured Documentation</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Created a clear "Getting Started" path that walked developers through setup in a logical 
                            sequence. Instead of scattered pages, we built a linear tutorial that got developers to 
                            their first successful API call in under 30 minutes.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Worked with engineering to improve SDK error messages. Instead of "Auth token invalid," 
                            developers now see: "Auth token invalid. Check that your token hasn't expired (tokens 
                            last 24 hours) and that you're using the correct environment (sandbox vs. production)."
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="cs-subheading">3. Comprehensive Code Examples</h3>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            Built a library of working code samples covering the most common integration scenarios. 
                            Each example included complete, runnable code with explanatory comments.
                        </p>

                            The hardest part wasn't defining the solution—it was coordinating implementation across

                            During this work, I noticed our team was spending 5 hours per week manually copying 
                            developer feedback from Jira into our Trello roadmap board. I built a Python script 
                            using REST APIs to automate the sync.

                            It was a small thing, but it taught me to always be looking for inefficiencies—not 
                            just in products, but in processes too.
