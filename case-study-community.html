                    <div class="cs-content">
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            When I became Vice President of NTU's faith-based fellowship club (180 members across 
                            3 language sections), I inherited an organization with a retention crisis. Only 30% of 
                            first-year members returned for their second year, and overall engagement was declining.
                        </p>
                        <p class="cs-text">
                            This wasn't a tech product, but the problem felt familiar: we had users (members) who 
                            were churning, and we didn't really understand why. The leadership team's default response 
                            was to plan more events and hope engagement improved. But throwing features at a problem 
                            without understanding the root cause rarely works—in tech products or community building.

                                <strong>The stakes:</strong> Low retention meant we were constantly recruiting to 
                                replace churned members instead of growing. It also meant most members never stayed 
                                long enough to develop deep connections or contribute meaningfully.

                            I conducted 30+ interviews with different member segments:

                        <p class="cs-text">
                            A clear pattern emerged: members who stayed had found a smaller group of 5-10 people they 
                            connected with deeply. Members who left felt they were just attending events without 
                            building real relationships.

                                <strong>The core problem:</strong> Our large-group events weren't creating the

                                we were optimizing for acquisition (event attendance) instead of retention (deep 
                                relationships).

                            Based on the research, I championed a structural change: creating subcommittees focused 
                            on specific interests and activities. Think of these as "micro-communities" within the 
                            larger fellowship.

                            <li><strong>Interest-based:</strong> Music, sports, service projects, Bible study—members

                            Rather than forcing the change top-down, I ran a pilot with 3 subcommittees first semester.

                            <strong>5. The meta-lesson:</strong> This experience reinforced that product management 
                            isn't about apps or software—it's about understanding what people need and building 
                            systems that deliver value. That applies everywhere.
